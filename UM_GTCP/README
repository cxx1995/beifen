Files
-----

  The current MPI/OpenMP code is in the src/mpi folder.
  bench_gtc.h        : common header file for all the kernels.
  bench_gtc_opt.h    : set optimizations and test parameters.
  bench_gtc_port.h   : include header files for SSE, aligned malloc.
  *.c                : the source files, following the same naming
                       convention as GTC-Simple.

  The reference serial and the Pthreads versions of the charge ans push 
  kernels will be moved to the "serial" and "pthreads" directories 
  under src. Please contact Kamesh Madduri (madduri@cse.psu.edu)

  The ARCH directory has Makefiles.

  The timing directory has portable timers (not being used in the MPI code).

Building the code
-----------------

  Edit one of the files in ARCH: see, for example, Makefile.hopper-opt or 
  Makefile.generic (serial).

  Build the code with
$ make ARCH=hopper-opt
  (or the appropriate Makefile suffix)
  This compiles the source files in the src/mpi directory.
   
  One executable will be built in src/mpi.

  Set USE_MPI to 0 (-DUSE_MPI=0) to build the serial code.

  Just compile without OpenMP flags to disable it.

Running the code
----------------

  Four config files A.txt, B.txt, C.txt, and D.txt are included in src/mpi/input. 
  The # of particles per cell and the number of toroidal domains are
  set with command-line arguments.

e.g., 
$ mpiexec -n 4 bench_gtc_carver_opt B.txt 20 4

  The # of particle domains is calculated based on the values of
  numberpe and ntoroidal. 
  npartdom = numberpe / ntoroidal

Important
---------

  Before running, make sure that the value of ASSUME_MZETA_EQUALS1 in the 
  file gtc_bench_opt.h is set correctly. This may be set to 1 when mzeta = 1
  (or mzetamax = ntoroidal), but should be 0 in all other cases.

  AUX_STORE1 and AUX_STORE2 in gtc_bench_opt.h should be set to 0 only for
  benchmarking the impact of stores.
  
Assumptions
-----------

  Some parameters are hard-coded in the current version, and code for 
  alternate cases has not been implemented yet. Hence be careful when
  modifying these values.
  
  nonlinear = 1.0  /* nonlinear = 0.0 requires some FFTs etc. */
  paranl    = 1.0  
  irun      = 0    /* always start sim from time step 0, no restart */
  nhybrid   = 0    /* adiabatic, not kinetic, electrons */ 
  mflux     = 5
  flow0     = flow1 = flow2 = 0
  nbound    = 4
  track_particles = 0
  iload     = 0
  ismooth   = 0    /* simplifies smooth */
 
Other things to note
--------------------

  The particle and field data structure variable names match 
  (in most cases) the Fortran names. However, 
  zion(1,:) is z0[], zion(2,:) is z1, ... , zion(6,:) is z5
  zion0(0,:) is z00[], zion0(1,:) is z01, ..., zion0(6,:) is z05

  All Fortran multidimensional arrays have been flattened to 1D, 
  0-indexed arrays in the C code.
